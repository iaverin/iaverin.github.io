        <p>Tags:&nbsp;#e-commerce, #platforms, #api, #integrations, #bigdata, #telecom</p>
        <p>Qvantel is a pioneer in the field of Business Support Systems (systems which connects the core tech platforms
            with the employes and clients by providing UIs, processes, reporting and etc) with over 20 years of
            experience of successful digital transformations for Telco Operators. This means that the company is the
            guru of tech integrations and UI/UX development. So the idea of creating the whitelabel platform solution
            for data-rich and digital-process powered companies &nbsp;was very logical and sustainable.</p>
        <p>Working close with the Sales &nbsp;Department I was responsible for the creation of concept and initial
            specification of platform based on existing company’s capabilities. These materials were used to pitch the
            clients and to design the product internally.</p>
        <p>Developed and documented following components (Use Cases, User Stories, &nbsp;UI/UX):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Marketplace Partners on-boarding and access flows</li>
            <li>Content Management System</li>
            <li>Reporting</li>

        <p>Tags:&nbsp;#retail, #analytics, &nbsp;#platforms</p>
        <p>In 2017 all russian retailers were requested to provide all cash register’s data to the state lineced
            aggregators. So that’s why the idea of analytical product based on these data came along. Based on
            technology stack of ad-tech company Credebat i’ve created the concept and specification for product which
            could be adopted by cash-register data aggregators in order to provide competitive analytical insights for
            small and medium retailers. The project was conducted to finalisation of requirements and agreement on
            several pilot launches with biggest cash data aggregators. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

        <p>Tags:&nbsp;#bigdata, #telecom, #rtb, #programmatic</p>
        <p>The primary assets of the DCA are the technology and expertise for data monetization applied in running the
            ad campaigns as Programmatic/Performance Advertising Agency. Thanks to these and my background in telecom we
            teamed-up with technical and commercial guys to compile the data monetization solutions for telecom
            operators and started to offer them on the market. The solution consists of the customized tech stack which
            could help telcos to increase their revenues both by more effectively and precisely running their promo
            campaigns and allow 3rd party businesses to rely on anonymized operator’s customers' data. I was doing the
            product design, presales, initial product pitches and later the project management of the first deployment.
            Later on, I've transferred the expertise on this solution to colleagues, so we could do more pitches and
            having more projects executed simultaneously.</p>
        <h2>Programmatic TV (Addressable TV)<img alt="image1" src="images/image1.png" class="img-fluid"></h2>

        <p>Role:&nbsp;product owner</p>
        <p>Tags:&nbsp;#bigdata, #telecom, #rtb, #programmatic</p>
        <p>While working on the TV ads optimization project in VimpelCom I’ve come out with the idea of targeting the TV
            ads on watcher's profiles. This could be done in digital environments and best suitable for implementation
            within the communications service providers who offers both the connectivity and TV services. I’ve googled
            and discovered that this concept realized in several single products offered mostly in US and UK. So, after
            a while, I became working in DCA for developing the Addressable TV ecosystem in Russia. During this work,
            we’ve developed the concept, business case, tech design and other things needed to be presented to potential
            partners and customers.</p>
        <p>I have managed to onboard several companies for pilot projects and kicked-off the partnership with the
            National Advertising Alliance (the monopolistic TV ads seller in Russia) in order to support them with
            ad-tech things.</p>

        <p>Tags:&nbsp;#bigdata, #media, #video, #iptv, #vod, #telecom</p>
        <p>I was helping the Media Department to initiate and run the project for implementation of Video On Demand
            content recommendation system within the Home TV product. The aim of the product was to increase the number
            of movies sold to subscribers. My role was to coordinate all the activities within the company in order to
            prepare all the needed materials to launch the project (business case, project scope, plan, KPIs and etc)
            and curate the project execution.</p>

        <p>Tags:&nbsp;#bigdata, #telecom, #analytics, #callcenter, #userexperience</p>
        <p>The purpose of the product was to create the tools which allow delivering the personalized and tailored
            offers for subscribers. Together with Digital channels and Customer Developments teams we’ve created the
            scope and product requirements. Since the target scope was very wide we decided to break into stages in
            order to start delivering the results earlier and fit the roadmap of digital channels development. After
            scoping and approving the roadmap with board I've assigned the project manager under my supervision to run
            the project. The final product was considered to be presented in all channels of communications, including
            POS.</p>

        <h2>TV ads placement optimization</h2>
        <p>Date: 2q2016</p>
        <p>Role:&nbsp;product lead</p>
        <p>Tags:&nbsp;#bigdata, #telecom, #analytics, #mediaplanngin, #optimisation</p>
        <p>The top-tier nationwide mobile c</p>
        <p>arrier spends a huge amount of money for its TV advertisement. The performance of the TV campaign is usually
            measured by hitting the initial set of the socio-demographic profile of watchers. However, &nbsp;there are 2
            problems: how correct the initial soc-dem targeting was set in accordance with product and is there a way to
            optimize the media mix for a particular product in order to expose the possible takers of offers with the
            ad? To solve these problems The BigData Monetisation team join efforts with the leading russian data
            analytics company - Yandex Data Factory in order to find out if it’s possible to use the data for
            optimization of TV campaigns. I was taking the role of shaping the project, &nbsp;kick-off the execution and
            track the implementation.</p>
        <p>There also other projects in cooperation with the Yandex Data Factory I’ve managed - you could find out all
            of them <a

        <p>Role:&nbsp;project lead</p>
        <p>Tags:&nbsp;#bigdata, #telecom, #analytics, #marketing, #realtime</p>
        <p>It’s the holy grail of marketing to find out the problem of customer and address it in right time. So In the
            mobile carrier environment, it seems that implementing the real-time marketing could be very convenient and
            cost effective because &nbsp;there are a lot of data and presence of free direct communication channels. For
            example: “The subscriber waits for a bus while it’s rainy. Let’s offer this person with the very particular
            entertainment (music or game) accompanied with the carrier’s data-bonus so he or she will feel care and some
            warm from us while experiencing our best data product”. Since I have a significant experience in telecom
            marketing at general I've taken the lead of development the product, which crucial part was to find out the
            offers and situations when they mostly appreciated and then try to detect it with the data analysis. The
            results of efforts were the list of more than 100 use cases when behavior data meets the product to offer.
            To make this list real it was developed the technical implementation design and IT architecture. The later
            execution of the project was conducted by project manager under my supervision.</p>

            implemented with the help of colleagues the process of the weekly operational performance monitoring. The
            report contains about the essential 20-25 KPIs and was different from previous reporting approach by having
            the KPIs which mostly were not financial so they were not presented in reporting systems and needed to be
            collected manually. Together with reporting systems, it was changed the way of business planning: from
            monthly basis to weekly basis. &nbsp;This reporting system allowed us to react very quickly in case that
            something was not going right.</p>

            So the new WEB site was designed and powered with the SAP’s Hybris E-commerce and Marketing solutions.
            Within the new site it was required to review and implement some new business processes like online support,
            physical goods reservations and etc. The site was implemented in 5 countries simultaneously.</p>
